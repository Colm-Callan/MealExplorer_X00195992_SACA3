# 1st big piece of work the page is now depoyed and has a random meal generator on it.

It works well is styled and has erro handling to some degree
the page is reasonably slow and some video form youtube are private/unavailable now yet still dispaly as 
begin able to be viewed and does still redirect you to youtube
a lot of research was a part of this on my api and how to implement some thing i was unsure of and 
definitely took the long way to do it but it functions as expected. A major help was the provided labs and the 
provided basic weather page was very useful for me to see how it was called and used to make that page

next i need to remove weather and counter from the sidebar and add my next page (meal based on ingredients you have)
